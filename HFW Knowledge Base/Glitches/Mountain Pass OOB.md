### Summary
Mountain Pass is a glitch that allows you to cross over the mountains west of plainsong, without completely establishing the Base.

### How to Do
##### Prerequisite
- You must be on Patch 1.18 (PS5 & PS4) to use [IJs](./Infinite%20Jumps.md)
- You must have Sunwing overrides unlocked (either through NG+ or progressing the Quest just far enough)

##### How to Do
1. Progress the Quest until you're outside the Base
2. Progress until you are at the point where you pry away some rocks in order to get back inside the mountain/base
3. Instead of prying the rocks, turn around and use [IJs](./Infinite%20Jumps.md) to get to a small bit with a platform
4. From there use [IJs](./Infinite%20Jumps.md) to get to the top of the mountain
5. Now throw a explosive spike towards the general direction of the Sunwing site, the goal is to get a Sunwing to where you are
6. Once the Sunwing has clipped through the invisible walls, use a pullcaster to pin the Sunwing down
7. Override the Sunwing
8. Clip yourself through the invisible walls by having the Sunwing pull you across
> You should now have access to most** of the rest of the map (Landfall is surrounded by a giant invisible wall at this stange in the game)
