### Summary
In HFW you can find quite a few holes in the map (even on latest patch). While these are generally useless (even in speedruns) you can get an interesting look below the map (actually you can't see anything but the underside of the map...). Anyways, the goal of this document is to list all we know about.

### Locations
**Base mountain**
###### Summary
Once you establish the base, the invisible wall around the outside area you have to progress during the quest is removed. Interestingly enough tho, the Rocks you have to pry away are replaced with wall. However this wall doesn't always load in immediately, giving you a window to the inside of the mountain.
