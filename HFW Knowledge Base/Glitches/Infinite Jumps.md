### Summary
Infinite Jumps, or Infinite jumping is a technique and bug that, doesn't allow the player to jump an infnite amount of times in place, rather it allows a player to scale over every wall in the game. Yes, even the shield around the Zenith base.

### How to Do
##### Prerequisite
- Downpatch your game to version 1.18
(or 1.0, however on that patch you can only do them after starting a NG and only until you RFS, die or FT)

##### On PS5
- Run against a wall
- Jump
- Hold Aim
- Let go of Aim
- Jump again/Repeat

##### On PS4
- Go to Settings and make sure Weapon Wheel slowdown is set to Slower or Slowest
	- Note: It might work on Normal too, but might be harder to achieve
- Run against a wall
- Jump
- Open the weapon wheel
- Wait until you see Aloy having an obvious animation of trying to stand up on a surface
- Close the weapon wheel and Jump immediately
